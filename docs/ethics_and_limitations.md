# Ethics, limitations, bias, and future work

## Intended use

The application is a **teacher-facing decision-support** tool. It may help staff notice students who might need tutoring, attendance mentoring, or wellbeing referral. It must not be used alone for streaming, expulsion, scholarship denial, or any irreversible academic judgement.

## What the system must not claim

- It does not measure intelligence, character, or future success.
- Test metrics will not be 100%. Real MAE/RMSE/R² and macro-F1 are stored in `artifacts/models/metrics.json`.
- A high-support label means “consider extra help,” not “this student will fail.”

## Privacy

- The public UCI files have no names or IDs. Keep it that way.
- The Streamlit form must not collect personally identifiable information.
- Exported JSON summaries contain academic fields and a disclaimer only.

## Bias and fairness risks

- Historical failures and extra-support flags can **re-encode disadvantage**: students who already received help may look “risky” forever.
- Parent education and job are socioeconomic proxies.
- Alcohol, romantic relationship, and family structure fields can invite stereotyped interpretations. Treat them as wellbeing context, not moral scores.
- Sex is excluded from predictors.
- Only two Portuguese schools from 2008 appear in the data. Transfer to another country or decade is not guaranteed.

## Leakage

G1 and G2 are excluded. If they were included, error would collapse and the product would stop being an early-warning system.

## Uncertainty and wrong predictions

- Residual plots and RMSE quantify typical score error (often around 2 points on a 0–20 scale; check the live metrics file).
- Class probabilities are shown so staff can see when the model is unsure.
- Missing `studytime` is tested as a robustness check during training.
- Incorrect predictions should be overridden by teachers; log disagreements if this were production.

## Model drift after deployment

Each term, compare:

1. Input distributions (absences, failures, studytime).
2. Predicted vs actual G3 once grades exist.
3. False-negative rate on the high-support group (missed students).

Retrain if those checks degrade. Do not silently reuse a 2008 model on a 2026 LMS dump without a new validation set.

## Future improvements

- Deep learning tabular models (TabNet) after a larger multi-school dataset exists.
- An LLM assistant that turns the explanation JSON into a parent-friendly letter, with a teacher in the loop.
- Learning-management clickstream instead of self-reported studytime.
- Fairness audits (equalized odds by school or address type) on a dataset that is large enough to support them.
